          <div class="contentText"><p>The San Juan Water District was formed by virtue of Resolutin No. 210 passed by the Local Sangguniang Bayan on December 13, 1976 to cover the entire municipality of San Juan. Resolution No. 210 was later amended and re-passed by the Sangguniang Bayan on January 10, 1977 to fully confirm to the provisions of P.D. 198 otherwise known as the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973 promulgated on May 25, 1973.</p><br />


        <p>Formerly, the San Juan Water District is a quasi-public corporation, politically independent from the local government. It was governed by a five-man Board of Directors and managed by a General Manager appointed by the Board. By virtue of 1992 Supreme Court ruling vs. Davao Water District et al, the San Juan Water District was transformed into a Government Owned and Controlled Corporating (GOCC), still governed by five-man Board of Directors and managed by General Manager.</p><br />
